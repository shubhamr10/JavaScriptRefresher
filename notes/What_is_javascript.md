### What is Javascript?
Javascript is a high-level object-oriented, multi-paradigm programming language.

1. Programming language : Instructs computer to do things.
2. High-level : We don't have to worry about the complex stuff like memory management.
3. Object-Oriented : Based on objects, for storing most kinds of data.
4. Multi-paradigm : We can use different styles of programming.

### The Role of Javascript in Web-development
A website is built upon following things:
1. HTML : CONTENT
2. CSS : Presentation
3. JS : Programming Language; Building web application.
---
### There is nothing you cannot do with Javascript (Well,almost...)
1. Dynamic effects and web applications in the browsers. JS, React, Angular, Vue.
2. 100% based on JavaScript, They might do away, but Javascript won't!.
3. Learn Javascript properly before jumping into frameworks as these framework changes, but the underlying content is Javascript.So, you should be well-knowledgeable in Javascript before jumping into any of the frameworks.
4. Web applications on Web servers -  JS and Nodejs.
5. Native mobile applications : React Native, Ionic, etc
6. Native desktop application : Electron JS.

### Javascript Releases...
1. ES5 (vanilla JS). ES --> ECMAScript
2. ES6 (ES2015). ** Major Update to the language
3. ES7 (ES2016).
4. ES8 (ES2017).
5. ES9 (ES2018).
6. ES10 (ES2019).
7. ES11 (ES2020).

### Values and Variables
1. "Shubham" > Value
2. 23 > Value
3. let firstName > variable
---
### Variable naming conventions
CamelCase --> firstName ** Standard
first_name
---
### Data types
 1. Objects
 2. Primitive

Objects = {  name : 'Jonas' };
let firstName = "Shubham"
----
### The 7 Primitive Data type
1. Number: Floating point numbers; Used for decimal and integers. Ex. let age = 23;
2. String: Sequence of characters; Used for text. let firstName = 'Jonas';
3. Boolean :  Logical type that can be only true or false; Used for taking decisions. let isValid = true;
4. Undefined: Value taken by a variable that is not yet defined.(`empty value`) let children;
5. Null : Also means `empty value`.
6. Symbol (ES2015): Value that is unique and cannot be changed.
7. BigInt(ES2020): Larger integer than the Number type can hold.
---
### Dynamic type
`JavaScript has a dynamic typing:` We do `not` have to manually define the data type of the values stored in a variable. Instead, data types are determined `automatically`.

---
### `const`, `var` and `let`
1. `const` : It is used to declare a non-mutable variable. It means it cannot be changed in future.
2. `let` : It is used to declare a mutable variable whose value needs to be changed. Also, `let` is a `block scoped`.
3. `var` : It is similar as `let` keyword. But, it is a `function scoped` declaration.
